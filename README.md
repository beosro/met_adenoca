Metastatic Adenocarcinoma Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Lung and colon adenocarcinoma are some of the most common cancers affecting numerous patients throughout the world. They frequently spread to other sites of the body. It is not uncommon that the pathologist is faced with the question if biopsy showing adenocarcinoma originated from lung or colon primary site. Pathologists are often forced to use special stains to help them make this determination. In the Medium post, I used two different machine learning libraries (fastai and Keras) to solve the origin of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
